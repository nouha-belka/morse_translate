# GHW Competition - Morse Code Translator

This repository was created as part of the GHW (GitHub World) competition. I participated in this event and completed the task of creating a Morse code translator. The translator converts both words to Morse code and Morse code to words. I used JavaScript for the algorithm and HTML/CSS for the page layout.

## Task Overview

The objective of the task was to develop a Morse code translator that could convert text to Morse code and vice versa. The challenge aimed to assess participants' programming skills, logic, and understanding of data structures.

## Solution

In this repository, you will find my solution to the Morse code translator implemented using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The code consists of three main files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.

## Code

The JavaScript code `script.js` contains the functions responsible for translating text to Morse code and Morse code to text.


The HTML file `index.html` contains the structure of the webpage, including input fields for text and Morse code, as well as buttons to trigger the translation functions. The CSS file `style.css` provides the styling and layout for the webpage.

## Usage

To use the Morse code translator, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ghw-morse-code-translator.git
```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Enter text in the "Text" input field to translate it to Morse code use "word to morse" mode, or use "morse to word" to translate it to text.

4. Click the corresponding "Translate" button to perform the translation.
5. The translated result will be displayed in the output area.

Please note that if there is a small problem with the translation from Morse code to words, where the last space translates to "undefined", you can modify the JavaScript code to handle this case specifically and remove the "undefined" translation.
